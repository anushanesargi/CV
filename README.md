## Anusha Nesargi

I have worked in various accounting roles for 3 years and later switched to a Reporting Analyst role as I wanted to explore the IT world because of my Computer Science Engineering degree.
I am an innovative, agile, emotive person and proven to be so in all my previous roles. I am very open to new experiences not just on a personal front but on a professional front too.
I now choose to delve into the developing side of the IT world as it very much appeals to the logical and analytical strength of mine.
